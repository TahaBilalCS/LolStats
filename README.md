LolStats is a Python program that uses the RIOT API for League of Legends to gather the statistics of any player in the game. The API only has
data from 2 years ago but that is sufficient for the average player. Using a player's global ID, you can also track their game history regardless of if they changed names or regions in the past.

Stats Include:
* Total Games Played
* Wins / Losses / Win Rate
* Hours Spent In Game Playing Specific Champion
* Oldest Patch Version Playing Specific Champion

Search Options Include: 
* Any game mode / champion / region
* Champion specific or non specific searches
* Batched player/champion searches so you can enter the values all at once and wait for the API to retreive everything




# FlameBot

Once you enter your username and API key into FlameBot, it will automatically pull statistics of all the players in your live game. 
This tells you who is more experienced playing their specific character.

In version 2 of FlameBot, you can even output the statistics for everyone in your game to see.
